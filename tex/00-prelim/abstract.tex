\begin{abstract}
Asset price/returns prediction is a widely studied problem in computational finance. Traditional econometrics approaches used time-series models or PDE's to describe single assets behaviors. More recently, deep-learning models that are able to capture temporal relationships, such as Recurrent Neural Networks, have been applied to this problem. However, these typically fail to capture true market dynamics where tradeable assets are linked with others through markets where agents trade multiple assets at once. Therefore, graph models and specifically Graph Neural Networks have been introduced to learn these relationships to produce better results. Several previous studies have shown the promise of this methodology and this work serves to demonstrate the same at a surface level. We adopt the frameworks of previous studies and apply it to a new set of assets and demonstrate the generalizability of the method. We show that the Temporal Graph Convolution (TGC) model outperforms other combination methods and significantly outperforms plain LSTM models.
