\section{Experiments}

We use the crypto data described above to train and test the performance of the different models. Due to computational limitations, we take the last 100k time steps with 90k time steps for training and the last 10k used as a test set. Training hyperparameters were tuned manually to find a reasonable best-performing combination.
