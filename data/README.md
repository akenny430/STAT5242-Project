The files in the dataset are too large to be uploaded and shared through GitHub,
so they must be added here manually.

To get the data, do the following:
1. Go to the [G-Research Crypto Forecasting competition homepage](https://www.kaggle.com/c/g-research-crypto-forecasting).
2. Under the "Data" tab,
click on the "Download All" on the right side of the screen.
The folder will be named `g-research-crypto-forecasting`.
3. Move this folder into the `data` directory here.
